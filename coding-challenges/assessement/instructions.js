// You can do these questions one by one on your own time or if you want to do it as an assessment then these were the instructions I was given:
    // 75 minutes max allowed
    // The coding exercise has 4 questions, where each question is more difficult than the previous question. You can do them in any order, though we recommend focusing on completing the first 2 questions before tackling questions 3 or 4.
    // Your exercise grading is primarily based on correctness, though our graders can manually review for code readability and technical design too.
    // Your solutions will receive partial credit if they solve some of the test cases.
    // You may reference online coding documentation, e.g. Python standard docs, though it is against policy to search for or copy answers from other sources.
