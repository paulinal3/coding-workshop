// You are moderating a newspaper page, and you have to align the text on the page properly. The text is provided to you in the following format:
    // paragraphs is an array of paragraphs, where each paragraph is represented as an array of words;
    // aligns is an array representing the alignment of each paragraph from paragraphs - each element is either "LEFT" or "RIGHT";
    // width represents the maximum number of characters each line of the output can include.

// Your task is to produce a newspaper page according to the following specifications:
    // For each paragraph paragraphs[i], include all the words paragraphs[i][j] in order, separated by spaces;
    // Include as many words as possible per each page line (the length of the line must be less than or equal to width), and put the next word on a new line if it would exceed the limit;
    // In the case of excess whitespace, words from paragraphs[i] should be aligned according to aligns[i] - if aligns[i] = "LEFT", the line should have trailing spaces, if aligns[i] = RIGHT, it should have leading spaces;
    // Include a border of * characters around all the edges of the result - these characters don't count toward the width, they are just added to make output more pretty.

// It is guaranteed that it is possible to justify the given paragraphs to the newspaper. Return the resulting newspaper page as an array of strings.
