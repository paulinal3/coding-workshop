// Take the attached Photoshop document and turn it into a single working web page (if you do not have Photoshop, let us know and we can send over a PDF). You can build in any way that you want using HTML, JS, CSS with a few exceptions:

// - Do not use front end frameworks for JS (ex. react, vue, etc).
// - Do not use Bootstrap or similar css libraries
// - Use Sass to write css

// The links on the page don’t need to go anywhere so you can set the href attribute to “#”. There are only a few requirements:

// - The final page should work across all screen sizes from a full width desktop down to mobile
// - The final page should work across modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
// - The tabs that say “all”, “even”, and “odd” should show/hide the appropriate boxes below. It should start off with “all” selected and all boxes showing.
// - We’ve included an example of what the boxes should look like when the user hovers over one.

// As a completely optional bonus, you can get the page up and running using Craft CMS to manage some of the page content.
